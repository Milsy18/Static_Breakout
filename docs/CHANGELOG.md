# CHANGELOG

## v18.2 (K-only)
- Removed slingshot/ema5 -7 gate; ENTRY = K-of-8 gates only.
- Kept legacy v7.1 ENTRY/EXIT **visuals only** (tiny dots above bars).
- Fixed NEAR logic (strict “close-but-not-passing”, no every-bar spam).
- Added bottom-right table; ML cont/bucket, k/8, readiness, NEAR flags.
- Repo hygiene: README, SYSTEM_MAP, sample_data (500 rows), .gitignore.
